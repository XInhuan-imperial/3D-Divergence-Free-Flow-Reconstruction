Input: 3D sparse/scattered velocity vectors

Output: 3D interpolated velocity vectors (can be full field flow in the domain), with the assumption that flow being incompressible.

Software: Matlab

Parameters to tune: shape parameter epsilon, usually set to be average distance between two nearest scattered input velocity vectors
